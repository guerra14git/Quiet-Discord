# ðŸ”Š Quiet Discord

**Quiet Discord** is a lightweight Python app that automatically adjusts your PC's audio settings at night â€” turning **up Discord** and **down the system volume** so you can hear your friends clearly without waking up the house.

## How It Works

During your configured hours, the app:

- **Increases Discord's volume**
- **Reduces the overall system volume**
- Automatically runs on an interval to keep volumes synced

Perfect for late-night gamers or voice chat users who struggle with low Discord audio.
